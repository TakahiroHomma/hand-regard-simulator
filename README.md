# hand-regard-simulator
Infants about two months old watch the movement of their hands, which is called hand regard. It is considered that after experiencing hand regard, infants may recognize their own hands. This hand-regard-simulator creates a simple model of hand regard and simulates the process by which infants recognize their hands.

To deal with time-varying input and output resulting from movements of infantâ€™s hands, a real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) algorithm is adopted and [RTRL software](http://www.bioinf.jku.at/software/rtrl/) is used.

The simulation results show that information about recognition of the modeled hands of the infant is stored in cell assemblies, which were self-organized. Cell assemblies appear during the phase of U-shaped developments of hand regard, and the configuration of the cell assemblies changes with each U-shaped development. Furthermore, movements like general movements appear during the phase of U-shaped developments of hand regard.
